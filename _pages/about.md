<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapre, supervised by Prof. [Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. of Artificial Intelligence from Nanjing University in 2022. In my undergraduate study, I worked with Prof. [Yang Yu](https://www.wolai.com/eyounx/dtR1MTyRXS5tP5Cex4KtdK) at LAMDA. I also interned at the MMLab of the Chinese University of Hong Kong with Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/), Kuaishou Technology with Dr. [Qingpeng Cai](https://qingpengcai.github.io/), Kunlun 2050 Research with Prof. [Shuicheng Yan](https://yanshuicheng.info/) and TikTok with Dr. [Qian Liu](https://siviltaram.github.io/).

I study safe, robust, and generalizable decision-making algorithms and their applications in real-world problems, such as large language models, GUI navigation, video games, autonomous driving, robotics locomotion, and recommendation systems.
